<h1> I’m Not as Strong as They Think I Am </h1>

<p>
I had a sick sense of pride in how far back I had to stick my finger this time. It had been so long since I’d purged that my body had forgotten what it felt like - how to make the “magic” happen. It didn’t take long for my reflexes to catch on though. The volume of what I was trying to get rid of wasn’t nearly as big as when I binged regularly - years and years ago. But tonight, I hadn’t binged. 
</p>
<p>
I was upset and ashamed that I had eaten badly (what the fuck does that even mean???). I knew I shouldn’t have eaten what I did but instead of saying I was having a bad food week and that so much in my life is changing and that it’s an uncertain time and that it’s life and that it’s ok and that I could change things the next day, I went with what feels safe: sabotage, self-loathing, pure hatred for what I look like, and the feeling that I have no self-control.
</p>
<p>
I ended up purging for close to 15 minutes. It’s probably one of the longest purges, if not the longest, that I’ve ever had.  I couldn’t stop until I thought I had gotten rid of it all, until there was nothing left but the shame and the guilt and the questions of how I can still do this to myself after coming so far. Some things never change. The entire time, I had the same audio track going that I always do when this happens. I tell myself you’re too fat and people don’t like you because you’re stubborn overbearing too honest you expect too much from people you’re plain you’re boring if you were thinner you would be a better athlete you don’t belong teaching classes everyone sees you for who you really are… and the thoughts keep coming until I want to scream.
</p>
<p>
I used to cry after every binge. But not this time. I’ve become so numb and so used to it that I had no tears. I just flushed the toilet, washed my mouth out, washed my hands, and left the bathroom. It was so routine. There’s no emotion. But maybe there is. I can’t tell anymore.
 </p>
<p>
Twenty years. I have spent twenty years of my life this way. I don’t remember being any other way. Growing up, I always heard constant comments about my weight and my body. An extended family member told me I was fat for the first time when I was 5. And I remember being forced to feel bad about how little I was eating (ironic, yes?) on a trip to NYC to see my great-grandparents. And then the memory flips to me being at a rest stop and throwing up all of my dinner. I was 9 years old. I didn’t purge. That was actually getting sick. But it set the stage. And almost 25 years later, I still remember how I felt that night.
</p>
<p>
I found pictures of myself when I was younger when I was cleaning out my house before the sale. I had hid all of them when I first moved in, because I was ashamed. And when I found them, I cried. A lot. Because I found out that there hadn’t been anything wrong with me at all. 
</p>
<p>
And because of all of this, everything that has happened, the years of shame, the confusion as to what’s “right” and what’s “wrong,” I hold on to this disease like it’s my security blanket. I’ve had my peaks and valleys, and I was well on my way to a full recovery until tonight. But my worry is that if I don’t have this disease anymore, I won’t be me. 
</p>
<p>
The rational me knows how stupid everything that I’ve written is - that I’m not fat and I have people who love me and that everyone has faults and if people don’t like me, it doesn’t matter. But if I recover from this disease, that means that I am no longer defined by it. Bulimia, which I’ve had for more than half of my life, will no longer hold me captive. And despite the fact that everyone tells me how strong I am, I’m not as strong as they think I am…
